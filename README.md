# gp-approx

gp-approx is a Python module for Gaussian Process regression with analytical approximation of uncertainty propagation.

This framework was developed on the basis of papers: [Gaussian Process priors with Uncertain Inputs:
Multiple-Step-Ahead Prediction](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rod/publications/GirRasMur02-TR-2002-119.pdf) and [Efficient Reinforcement Learning
using Gaussian Processes](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/13927/10/thesis_mpd_corrected.pdf)
